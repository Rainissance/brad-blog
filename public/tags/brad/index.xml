      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several wonderful pieces that exist of Brad the axolotl, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to compiling all the wonderful artwork people have created for this silly little axolotl, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make this blog post to collect all the pieces people have created of him. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of, we have this &lt;strong&gt;nice image&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/arftistic.bsky.social&#34;&gt;Arftistic&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/art-of-brad/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Digital illustration of Brad wearing his iconic jumper and his rainbow wristband. Next to him is smaller, younger version of him.&#34;&gt;&#xA;This was drawn by a lovely member of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ironfurs.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Iron Furs&lt;/a&gt; after he visited Belfast. Here in this image, he is wearing his cozy sweather and next is a drawing of him as a baby. So cute!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
