Hello everyone! 

This may be a bit of surprise, but I decided to make a blog for Brad! I've always wanted to try my hand at coding a static site blog and decided to test the waters out with making a cute little blog for Brad!!

I originally had a Tumblr blog for Brad and his friends, however I do not enjoy posting onto Tumblr. The UI of Tumblr is sloppy, and the moderation on there has a bias towards queer content. 

I've also wanted to drift away from social media to share my thoughts and writing. Over the last three years, there's been a general discussion about the harms of having community primarily based on privately owned platforms and the harms it causes to users and the inevitability of enshittenfication. 

Instead I've created a small blog website without these issues, developed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I hope you will enjoy this blog as I plan to update this further in the future. For now, just have this cute post :D
