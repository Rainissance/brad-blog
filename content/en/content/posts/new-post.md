Hello everyone! 

This may be a bit of surprise, but I decided to make a blog for Brad! I've always wanted to try my hand at coding a static site blog and decided to test the waters out with making a cute little blog for Brad!!

I originally had a Tumblr blog for Brad and his friends, however I do not enjoy posting onto Tumblr. The UI of Tumblr is sloppy, and the moderation on there has a bias towards queer content. 

I've also wanted to drift away from social media to share my thoughts and writing.
