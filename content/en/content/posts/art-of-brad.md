There are several wonder pieces that exist of Brad the axolotl, and I haven't gotten around to compiling all the wonderful artwork people have created for this silly little axolotl, so I've decided to make this blog post to collect all the pieces people have created of him. Yay!

First of, we have this nice image by (Arftistic)[https://bsky.app/profile/arftistic.bsky.social].
