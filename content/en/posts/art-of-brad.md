There are several wonderful pieces that exist of Brad the axolotl, and I haven't gotten around to compiling all the wonderful artwork people have created for this silly little axolotl, so I've decided to make this blog post to collect all the pieces people have created of him. Yay!

First of, we have this **nice image** by [Arftistic](https://bsky.app/profile/arftistic.bsky.social) .

This was drawn by a lovely member of [Iron Furs](https://www.ironfurs.co.uk/) after he visited Belfast. Here in this image, he is wearing his cozy sweather and next is a drawing of him as a baby. So cute!

Next we have another piece of artwork of Brad, this time underwater by [Inevitable_Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/@the_inev1table).

Personally, I'm a big fan of his :3 face.
